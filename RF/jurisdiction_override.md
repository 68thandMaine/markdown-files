## Description

When a customer wants work done on their property, different products are available based on the jurisdiction that they live in. This functionality is accessed via the **Pipeline** under the **Provide Project Info** section. A list of products is displayed, and this list should be generated by a backend service like Panda, but prior to that, Panda needs to know the jurisdiction the project is being completed in.
